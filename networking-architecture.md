-   Security group with inbound rule, address prefix, and subnet for Secure Automated Backup with Compass.

Cloud Native Connectivity (to cloud services)

Provide secure connection to Cloud Services

VPC Gateway + Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE)

Private Cloud Service endpoints

Public Cloud Service Endpoints

VPC Gateway + Virtual Private Endpoints (VPE)

-   VPC Gateway + Virtual Private Endpoints enable connectivity to IBM Cloud services by using private IP addresses allocated from a VPC subnet.

Cloud Landing-zone Connectivity

Connect across multiple VPCs and to IBM Cloud Classic, PowerVS environments

Transit Gateway (TGW)

Power Edge Router (PER)

Global Transit Gateway (GTGW)

Transit Gateway

Power Edge Router (PER)

-   Transit gateways (TGW) are used for interconnectivity between PowerVS and VPCs. Transit Gateways have built in redundancy. TGWs are regional and are deployed 2 per AZ within the same region.

-   Power Edge Routers (PER) are also deployed as 2 per region. PER is used for interconnectivity between PowerVS and the TGW. For more information see getting started with PER https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/power-iaas?topic=power-iaas-per

Cloud Landing-zone Connectivity across regions

Connect across regions

Global Transit Gateway (GTGW)

Global Transit Gateway (GTGW)

-   interconnects classic, VPCs and PowerVS resources across regions.

-   connect to environments in other regions for resiliency data replication purposes.

Domain Name System (DNS)

Ability to resolve DNS names on site

IBM Cloud DNS

IBM continues to forward or relay the DNS to client DNS Servers onsite

IBM continues to forward or relay the DNS to client DNS Servers onsite

-   This is the default option in the absence of a specific customer requirement to manage DNS

-   Name resolution for the backup server connections is required.
