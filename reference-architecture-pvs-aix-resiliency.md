# Power Virtual Server Resiliency on AIX
{: #power-virtual-server-on-AIX}
{: toc-content-type="reference-architecture"}
{: toc-version="1.0"}







This is a baseline solution pattern containing the design and architecture decisions for a PowerVS resiliency solution for AIX workloads to meet common requirements as noted in this use case. Actual solutions depend on the specific requirements that are set by the client. Below is a summary of the use case for this reference architecture:

Environments related to this reference architecture:

-   Primary Environment â€“ added to the primary datacenter

    -   BaaS VPC deployed as part of the backup service automation; not for workloads

-   Secondary IBM Cloud datacenter for disaster recovery workloads

    -   Edge VPC for firewall

    -   Management VPC for management tool stacks to manage VPC, PowerVS environments

    -   PowerVS Environment - workload PowerVS workspace, workload/GRS controller LPARs

## Design Scope
{: #design-scope}

The PowerVS resiliency for AIX workloads architecture covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains (as defined in the [Architecture Design Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro)):

-   Compute: Virtual Servers

-   Storage: Primary Storage, Backup Storage, Archive Storage

-   Networking: Enterprise Connectivity, BYOIP/Edge gateways, Segmentation, Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity, Domain name system

-   Security: Data security, Identity and access management, Infrastructure and endpoint security

-   Resiliency: Backups and Restore, High Availability, Disaster Recovery

The Architecture Framework provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a set of "aspects" and "domains", which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. See [Introduction to the Architecture Design Framework](https://cloud.ibm.com/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro) for more details.

Following the Architecture Design Framework, Resiliency for PowerVS covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:

## Design scope 
{: #design-scope}

Following the [Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-taxonomy), pattern-name covers design considerations and architecture decisions for the following aspects and domains:


- **Compute:** Bare Metal and Virtual infrastructure

- **Storage:** Primary, Backup, Archive and Migration

- **Networking:** Enterprise Connectivity, Edge Gateways, Segmentation and Isolation, Cloud Native Connectivity and Load Balancing

- **Security:** Data, Identity and Access Management, Infrastructure and Endpoint, Threat Detection and Response

- **Resiliency:** Backup and Restore, Disaster Recovery, High Availability

- **Service Management:** Monitoring, Logging, Alerting, Management/Orchestration

The Architecture Framework, described in [Introduction to the Architecture Framework](/docs/architecture-framework?topic=architecture-framework-intro), provides a consistent approach to design cloud solutions by addressing requirements across a pre-defined set of aspects and domains, which are technology-agnostic architectural areas that need to be considered for any enterprise solution. It can be used as a guide to make the necessary design and component choices to ensure you have considered applicable requirements for each aspect and domain. After you have identified the applicable requirements and domains that are in scope, you can evaluate and select the best fit for purpose components for your enterprise cloud solution.

The Figure 3 shows the domains that are covered in this solution.

| Resiliency | Multi-site capability to support a disaster recovery strategy and solution leveraging IBM Cloud infrastructure DR capabilities|
| | Provide backups for data retention|
| | RTO/RPO = 4 hours/15 minutes; Rollback to original environments should occur no later than specified RTOs |
| | 99.95 Availability|

| | - Prod: Daily Full, logs per SAP product standard, 30 days retention time \n - Non-Prod: Weekly full, logs per SAP product standard, 14 days retention time|
| Service management | Provide Health and System Monitoring with ability to monitor and correlate performance metrics and events and provide alerting across applications and infrastructure |
| | Ability to diagnose issues and exceptions and identify error sources|
| | Automate management processes to keep applications and infrastructure secure, up to date, and available |
| Other| Migrate SAP workloads from existing data center to IBM Cloud VPC |
| | Customer's SAP systems and applications run on NetWeaver (application) & HANA (DB), AnyDB or S/4 HANA |
| | Provide an Image Replication migration solution that will minimize disruption during cut-over|
| | Cloud infrastructure for the proposed IAAS solution must be SAP Certified |
| | IBM Cloud IaaS will be deployed to support SAP and surrounding non-SAP workloads |
| | Customer does not want to adopt [RISE](https://www.ibm.com/consulting/rise-with-sap?utm_content=SRCWW&p1=Search&p4=43700077624079785&p5=e&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIr9bRlt7LgQMVJdHCBB0cewwcEAAYASAAEgIVgfD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds) at this time but wants to consider Cloud deployment solution that would facilitate a future RISE transformation|

As mentioned earlier, the Architecture Framework is used to guide and determine the applicable aspects and domains for which architecture decisions need to be made. The following sections contain the considerations, and architecture decisions for the aspects and domains that are in play in this solution pattern.
