| Data encryption at rest of primary storage | Encrypt all application data to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. | - Storage encryption with customer-managed keys \n - App-level encryption with customer-managed keys | text | text |
| Data encryption at rest of backups | Encrypt all backup data to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. | text | text | text |
| Data encryption at rest of logs | Encrypt all operational and audit logs at rest to protect them from unauthorized disclosure. | text | text | text |
| Data encryption in transit of web app | Encrypt all application data in transit to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. | Application-level encryption with TLS | Application-level encryption with TLS | Web app uses HTTPS protocol to encrypt data transmissions. |
| Data encryption in transit of DB tier | Encrypt all application data in transit to protect it from unauthorized disclosure. | Application-level encryption with TLS | Application-level encryption with TLS | The database application uses TLS to encrypt data in transit. |
